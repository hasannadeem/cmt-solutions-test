# CMT Solutions

CMT Solutions is a web application that is able to retrieve a providerâ€™s details based on their National Provider Identifier (NPI). User is searching the provider using NPI and details of the provider is stored in the database so we don't need to call public api to get details of a provider if it's requested again and also we keep track of all the searched Providers and top searched providers NPI and their count. To see more details of a provider, users can click on the show button and see the details of that provider which includes addresses, taxonomies, other_names, practice_locations and endpoints details of this provider.
